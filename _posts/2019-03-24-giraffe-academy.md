Giraffe Academy is rebranding! I've decided to re-focus the brand of this channel to highlight myself as a developer and teacher! The newly minted Mike Dane channel will have all the same content, with more to come in the future!

Jekyll Docs - <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/>

This video is one in a series of videos where we'll be looking at building static websites using the Jekyll framework. The course is designed for intermediate web developers, and will introduce some of the core concepts of Jekyll in an easy to follow manner.

Throughout the course we'll be looking at various topics including content organization, templates, data files, conditionals, front matter and much more.
